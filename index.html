            <p>Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.
                You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.
                You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.
                The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job.

                A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment.
                Use it. Make friends with it.
                You create the dream - then you bring it into your world.
                The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction.
                Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. No worries.
                No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around.

            <p>There we go. You can't have light without dark.
                You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.
                A fan brush can be your best friend.
                We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.
                All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.
                Even the worst thing we can do here is good.</p>
